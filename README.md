# Tetris, in Go

This simple library was extracted from a programming contest that
[David Adair](https://github.com/adairdavid) and I entered together.  It was a
fun little project and we intend to improve it as time permits.  The implication
here is that this is not a full-fleged library but it can do some basic tetris
related data work.  Some of the data structures are based on requirements from
the contest and are subject to change (ideas welcome!).
